# NOTE:
#   - I should put here the common things as PATH and Aliases but I don't want to maintain two file so I will assume each interactive shell is always a login shell.
#   - This is always true for OSX but might not be true for unix systems. Whatever.
#   - I DO NOT source this file from .bash_profile

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
