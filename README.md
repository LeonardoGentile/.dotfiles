#Dotfiles

This repository represents my personal "dotfiles", settings and instructions to setup the perfect development environment on a Mac Os X machine. This will help me to setup again a machine after a fresh install and hopefully help someone else out there. 

These settings have been tested on __Mac Os X Mavericks__ and __El Capitan__ but they can be adapted to another Os X version with some tweaks.   

#Preparation 
Before installing the dotfiles I perform some extra steps to assure to have everything functioning for the following steps  

1. If installing under Mac Os then open the files [osx_installation/README.md](./osx_installation/README.md) and follow the instruction under the __Preparation__ section.
2. Generate github and bitbucket [`ssh` keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys):  
    - run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"`    
    - enter a passphrase (annotate it!)  
    - pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  
    - go to __Github__  `profile/account/Edit Profile/SSH Keys/Add SSH Key` and paste the previously copied ssh key. You can follow a similar  process for  Bitbucket  
        - `ssh -T git@github.com` to verify that the settings are ok
        - The first time you will be asked to insert your pass-phrase, do it and then tell keychain to remember it. From now on you won't be asked again for the pass-phrase.   
        - In case everything was set up  correctly you should get a message `Hi YourUserName! You've successfully authenticated, but 
        GitHub does not provide shell access.`
    - go to __BitBucket__ `Profile/ Bitbucket Settings/ SSH Keys/ Add Key`
        + switch the default url scheme from https to ssh


#Dotfiles installation 

## Step 1: Installation script

1. `cd ~ `
2. `git clone --recursive git@github.com:LeonardoGentile/.dotfiles.git`   
    if you forgot `--recursive` option then `cd .dotfiles; git submodule update --init`
3. `cd .dotfiles`
4. `sh install_dotfiles.sh`
5. `cd powerline-shell`
6. edit `config.py` (optional)
7. `python install.py`


This script will:  

1. create two directories inside your home directory called `.dotfiles_old` and `bin_old` 
2. move all existing files contained in the  `files` variable (see step 4 for the list) from your home directory to the `.dotfiles_old` directory (so you may restore your original files if anything goes wrong)
3. move your `~/bin` directory (if it exists) to `~/old_bin` (as of point 2 for backup reasons)   
__IMPORTANT:__ if you repeat these steps a second time your personal dotfiles and `bin` directory (and its contents) will be lost forever! So please put them in a safe place if you really need them!
4. symlink the following files `.bash_profile .bashrc .gitattributes .gitconfig .gitignore_global .inputrc .osx .gvimrc .hushlogin .vimrc .wgetrc`
from the `~/.dotfiles` directory to your your home directory.   
__NOTE__: change the `files` variable if you want to change this list
5. symlink the `~/.dotfiles/bin` directory to `~/bin`

__Why symlinking?__  
Whenever you want to modify a files that you are tracking (for example your `.bash_profile`) you can just `cd ~` and edit it from there. What will be actually modified is `~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile`. This way all the dotfiles are cleaned organized in the `.dotfiles` directory and you don't have to remember which files in your home is versioned or not.

## Step 2: Dotfiles privates (optional)
Apart from my public dotfiles I keep some private settings in a private repository.
Some files I keep there: 

 - "extra" dotfiles 
    - `.bashmarks_dirs`  (extra "bookmarks" directories for bashmarks)
    - `.git_extra` 

            [user]
                name = Name Surname
                email = myemail@myprovider.com
    - ` .shuttle.json` for [shuttle](http://fitztrev.github.io/shuttle/)
    - `.z` database for [z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
    - `config` ssh "bookmarks" config file compatible with `shuttle`  
- applications settings 
    + [betterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net) becase I hate how the default gestures have changed after snow leopard 
    + [Karabinier](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) because it solves all the problems that apple will never solve 
        + `org.pqrs.KeyRemap4MacBook.plist` 
        + `private.xml`

For installing these private files I do:

- `cd ~`
- `git clone my-private-repo-url.git`
- `cd .dotfiles-privates`
- `sh install_private.sh` where `install_private.sh` is a script similar to the one you can see in the step1 that simlynks and copies files around to the right destination, for example:

        dir=~/.dotfiles-privates            # dotfiles directory
        olddir=~/.dotfiles-private_old      # old dotfiles backup directory
        
        # list of files/folders to symlink in homedir
        files=".git_extra .shuttle.json"
        
        # create dotfiles-private_old in homedir
        echo "Creating $olddir for backup of any existing dotfiles-privates in ~"
        mkdir -p $olddir
        # move any existing dotfiles in homedir to dotfiles-private_old directory, then create symlinks
        for file in $files; do
            echo "Moving $file from ~ to $olddir"
            mv ~/$file $olddir
            echo "Creating symlink to $file in home directory.\n"
            ln -s $dir/$file ~/$file
        done

        # BASHMARKS DIRS
        echo "Moving .bashmarks_dirs config from ~/.bashmarks_dirs to $olddir"
        mv ~/.bashmarks_dirs $olddir
        echo "Linking bashmarks_dirs from ~/.bashmarks_dirs to $dir/.bashmarks_dirs\n"
        ln -s $dir/.bashmarks_dirs ~/.bashmarks_dirs

        # Z database
        echo "Moving .z from ~/.z to $olddir"
        mv ~/.z $olddir
        echo "Linking .z from $dir/.z to ~/.z\n "
        ln -s $dir/.z  ~/.z

        # SSH CONFIG
        echo "Moving ssh config from ~/.ssh/config to $olddir"
        mv ~/.ssh/config $olddir
        echo "Linking ssh config from .ssh/config to $dir/config\n"
        ln -s $dir/config ~/.ssh/config

        # Karabiner private.xml Config file
        mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/Karabiner/private.xml $olddir
        echo "Linking private.xml from from ~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml to $dir/private.xml\n"
        ln -s $dir/private.xml  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Karabiner/private.xml
        
        mv ~/Library/Preferences/org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist $olddir
        echo "Linking private.xml from from ~/Library/Preferences/org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist to $dir/org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist\n"
        ln -s $dir/org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist  ~/Library/Preferences/org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist

## Wrapping it up
The `install_dotfiles.sh` script from the step 1 doesn't symlink everything, in fact it will __copy__ some files instead from `~/.dotfiles` to `~/`:

- `.bashmarks_dirs`
- `.git_extra`

I do so because these are files that I do NOT want to track. The `install_dotfiles.sh` (step 1) copies them in home and if I edit them in `home` nothing will happens to the `.dotfiles` repo.  Usually I overwrite these files with the ones coming from `.dotfiles-private` (`install_private.sh` from step 2)

#VoilÃ !
That's all folks! I spent and I keep on spending a lot of time on my personal dev enviroment and setting it up was not easy. I hope this will help someone. Things are a little dirty and I should clean them up a little bit. Feel free to grab my code and make some correction to the dumb things I've created or written ;)
