Synopsis:
    $funcName [-g|-G] [command [param1 ...]]

Description:
    Opens a $targetDesc and optionally executes a command.

    The new $targetType will run a login shell (i.e., load the user's shell profile) and inherit
    the working folder from this shell (the active Terminal tab).
    IMPORTANT: In scripts, \`$funcName\` *statically* inherits the working folder from the
    *invoking Terminal tab* at the time of script *invocation*, even if you change the
    working folder *inside* the script before invoking \`$funcName\`.

    -g (back*g*round) causes Terminal not to activate, but within Terminal, the new tab/window
      will become the active element.
    -G causes Terminal not to activate *and* the active element within Terminal not to change;
      i.e., the previously active window and tab stay active.

    NOTE: With -g or -G specified, for technical reasons, Terminal will still activate *briefly* when
    you create a new tab (creating a new window is not affected).

    When a command is specified, its first token will become the new ${targetType}'s title.
    Quoted parameters are handled properly.

    To specify multiple commands, use 'eval' followed by a single, *double*-quoted string
    in which the commands are separated by ';' Do NOT use backslash-escaped double quotes inside
    this string; rather, use backslash-escaping as needed.
    Use 'exit' as the last command to automatically close the tab when the command
    terminates; precede it with 'read -s -n 1' to wait for a keystroke first.

    Alternatively, pass a script name or path; prefix with 'exec' to automatically
    close the $targetType when the script terminates.

Examples:
    $funcName ls -l "\$Home/Library/Application Support"
    $funcName eval "ls \\\$HOME/Library/Application\ Support; echo Press a key to exit.; read -s -n 1; exit"
    $funcName /path/to/someScript
    $funcName exec /path/to/someScript
