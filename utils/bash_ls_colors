# LS COLORS
# =================

# I'm not currently using "ls" but "gls", that is the "GNU ls"
# as defined in .bash_profile.
# So I'm not using this file.

# The values in LSCOLORS are codes corresponding to different colors for different types of files.
# The letter you use indicates which color to use, and the position in the string indicates
# what type of file should be that color. Each color comes in pairs â€“ a foreground color and a
# background color. Here is a list of color values:

# a = black
# b = red
# c = green
# d = brown
# e = blue
# f = magenta
# g = cyan
# h = grey
# A = dark grey
# B = bold red
# C = bold green
# D = yellow
# E = bold blue
# F = magenta
# G = cyan
# H = white
# x = default

# And here is a list of the positions in LSCOLORS:

# directory
# symbolic link
# socket
# pipe
# executable
# block device
# character device
# executable with setuid set
# executable with setguid set
# directory writable by others, with sticky bit
# directory writable by others, without sticky bit

export CLICOLOR=1
